# My Apple Health Archives and Tools

All my personal data collected in Apple Health is in this repo along with the
tools I've built to process it. I use a Garmin Vivoactive HR right now, and also
used a Microsoft Band in the past. Both of these placed data into my Apple
Health record and a lot of my algorithms rely upon this. Feel free to play
around with these tools, and I trust my personal data will be used for only
beneficial purposes.
